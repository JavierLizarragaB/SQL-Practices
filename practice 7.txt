Cleaning data
-data can be wrong, to avoid bigger problems with this we need to clean it
We can:
Find duplicates
-sometimes data is inputed twice, we need to find which data to delete it
/////////////////
SELECT company,
      street,
      city,
      st,
      count(*) AS address_count
  FROM meat_poultry_egg_establishments
  GROUP BY company, street, city, st
  HAVING count(*) > 1
  ORDER BY company, street, city, st;
/////////////
Missing data 
-other times it dosent get inputed at all but the field still exists with a NULL value
/////////////////
SELECT establishment_number,
       company,
       city,
       st,
       zip
FROM meat_poultry_egg_establishments
WHERE st IS NULL;
/////////////
Add constrains
-maybe someone ignore data constrains and entered it in other formats
/////////////////
SELECT st,
       count(*) AS st_count
FROM meat_poultry_egg_establishments
WHERE length(zip) < 5
GROUP BY st
ORDER BY st ASC;
/////////////////
Backups
-before trying to fix anything get a backup just in case
/////////////////
Create table backup as select Select * from originalTable;
/////////////////
